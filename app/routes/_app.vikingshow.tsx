            The Viking ship Saga Farmann embarked on an epic adventure in 2023 to explore the peoples and cultures of Europe and to rediscover the ancient Viking connections along the historic trade routes.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground">
            Over the years of sailing, the crew of Saga Farmann has encountered remarkable hospitality and gained a much deeper understanding of the history of the countries once visited by the Vikings. In almost every port, the ship and her crew have been warmly welcomed, with great interest shown in both the vessel and the rich history of the Viking age.
