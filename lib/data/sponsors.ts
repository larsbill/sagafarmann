Since 2018, SeaDrive and the Oseberg Viking Heritage Foundation, who built Saga Farmann, have been working in a partnership to develop and test an electrical propulsion solution. Today SeaDrive sells these POD's to a large variety of customers throughout Europe - all based on an idea for a Viking ship.",

These fundings gave us the confidence that the voyage can be done and gave us motivation to carry on the preparation for the voyage. It is obvious that without Wilhelmsen supporting us we would not have been able to leave Tønsberg - Thank you",

From the very first attempt to electrify our ship, BlueTec has helped us with cabling and electric installations on board. As a test ship for solutions under development the installations were not permanent and every year a new installation or at least an upgrade was needed. Deadlines and challenging tasks has been handled nicely by BlueTec and for that we're truly grateful - Thanks",

    description: "Call the plumber! In the last weeks before departure we were told that in order to get our ship certified to enter EU (Germany) we needed to have all tubes from inlets under the waterline to be exchanged with steel pipes and swans neck above waterline.....Luckily Terjesen, the leading plummer in the area stepped in with short notice and fixed the plumbing. Very fast response and nice plumbing that even a viking must adore - thank you Terjesen",

With these funds we could undertake the planning of the voyage and kick of the initiatives needed to get momentum. Saga Farmann will bring our viking heritage out to people of Europe but our County definitely delivered a nice kick at the right time for us to get started - thanks",

    description: "Our RIB is one of our most important safety measures and a versatile tool for the voyage. Our RIB is used to add power to the ship when needed acting as an external engine for pushing or pulling the ship. But also the RIB is used for logistic purposes running to and from shore with crew, food or fuel. Mercury has delivered a new 50Hp outboard engine for a very reasonable price making sure that we can rely on our important RIB on this long voyage - Thank you Mercury",

With the Eltek solution we can consume both generator and shore based electricity, convert it to 48V DC and charge our batteries. But most important is that Eltek has provided us with competence, spareparts and man hours to make sure that we can charge our ship anywhere and with confidence to adjust to almost any power source we meet - well done Eltek",

    description: "Apples were vital for Vikings as a reliable food source in Scandinavia's harsh climate. Also, apples is a source of vitapmin C, preventing scurvy during long winters and sea voyages. Culturally, apples held symbolic weight, and Idun's apple granted gods eternal youth. Soli eplemost will not guarantee you eternal youth, but we still think it tastes godly.",

    name: "Fischer Panda",
    description: "Even though Saga Farmann is a true Viking ship, complete with sails and spirit, we need a bit more than wind and warrior grit to keep our modern navigation systems and electrical gear running. After all, we can't just sit around waiting for favorable winds like the old Norsemen did — “patience” isn't exactly a captain's favorite word. That's why we've got two trusty Fisher Panda generators on board. These quiet little workhorses keep our battery bank charged and ready, no matter what the weather's up to. They're so silent, you'll find yourself checking twice to see if they're even running — a huge bonus when the crew is living shoulder to shoulder 24/7 and new sailors are constantly joining the adventure. Big thanks to Fisher Panda for keeping the power flowing and the crew smiling. The Vikings would've loved you — if only they'd known what electricity was.",
